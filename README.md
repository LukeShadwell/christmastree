SuperSocial - Christmas Tree Interview

# task
Create a ModuleScript which generates a christmas tree in 3D space, using only code. The height of the christmas tree should vary randomly each time the function is called, and you should only use basic Parts.

### Notes:
1. Your christmas tree should have at least two types of part: trunk and leaves. If you get time, feel free to add other features to your tree such as baubles, a star, or tinsel.
2. The tree should be widest at the bottom, and smallest at the top.
3. Position your tree at 0,0,0 in world coordinates.

Some other ideas of additions:
- Making the tree cone shaped (rather then rectangular)
- Decorate your tree
- Make the trunk larger at the bottom and smaller at the top

### Bonus:
Use Rojo & VSCode, and push your finished version to a github repository.
